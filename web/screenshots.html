    <h2>Screenshots</h2>
	<h3>Terrain</h3>
	<p>The first screenshots simply show a region of sliced (customized)
	terrain.  Note the sky shading which uses the same algorithm as
	Fly! II and is fully compatible with the Fly! II Sky Tweaker and
	any custom skies.ini settings.  It is important to note that in this
	prototype terrain system
	implementation, only low-resolution terrain textures are supported.
	These were taken at the "proof of concept" point when support for sliced
	scenery was first being implemented.
	The	sliced terrain is Dominique Klein's Lake Tahoe, and the aircraft is
	ROTW's Seneca V.

	<p>The next screenshots compare transitions between custom (sliced) terrain
	and the default worldwide terrrain in Fly! II and Fly! Legacy.
	Note that in Fly! II, there are "gaps" due to mismatches between the
	higher-resolution elevation data in the sliced terrain area, and the
	more sparse elevation data of the default terrain.  Today's faster
	processors may make it feasible to seamlessly blend these areas.
	<p>First, the transition area in Fly! II:
	<img src="screenshots/Fly2_TahoeEdge.jpg"><br>
	<p>and the same region in Fly! Legacy:
	<img src="screenshots/Legacy_TahoeEdge.jpg"><br>
	<p>Again, remember that the Fly! Legacy terrain engine is only using
	very low-resolution textures at this time so the terrain lacks sharpness.
	With the terrain system in wireframe debugging mode, you can see how
	the sparse default terrain area blends into the adjacent higher-resolution
	sliced terrain area by the addition of more vertices and triangles
	as required:

	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	Fly! Legacy will support all of the custom user interface widgets
	implemented in the Fly! II user interface.  Screenshots of the
	widget implementations (in-progress) will be uploaded soon.

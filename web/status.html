    <h2>Development Status</h2>
    <p>Fly! Legacy is currently at the Pre-Alpha stage of development.  What does this mean?
       Basically, it means that the design and implementation has not progressed far enough
       for the application to operate as any kind of complete flight simulator.
       There are major areas which have extremely limited or no implementation available.
       Many other areas are in only very preliminary stages of implementation.
       Some areas that may appear to be implemented may only use a limited prototype or placeholder
       implementation that will require significant re-work in the future. 
       In the Pre-Alpha stage, the application is considered to be usable only be active developers,
       not by typical end users.

    <p>The current objective is to progress the implementation to an Alpha technology demo.
       At the Alpha stage, there is enough implementation for end users to begin to use the application.
       Compared to the existing capabilities of Fly! II, there will still be significant limitations.
       There will likely be quite a few design and coding defects, resulting in functional errors (bugs)
       and stability problems (crashes).

    <p>Following achievement of the Alpha build, development will progress to the Beta stage.
       At this stage, practically all functionality will be present in the simulator in order to achieve
       a high level of functional parity with Fly! II version 2.5.240.
       Any prototype or placeholder implementations should be replaced with "final" designs.
       The user community will be invited to participate more actively in using the application as a
       complete flight simulator package and reporting bugs to the development team.

    <p>The following table provides a summary of design and implementation progress in all major categories
       of the application.
       The % complete is a very arbitrary guess, given that in most cases there is not a complete design spec
       that is being coded to.
       The categories are very high-level and are just conveniences for grouping areas of the software.

    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>Fly! Legacy is a completely non-commercial endeavor, so there will never
	be any monetary contribution required to the project. 
	<p>We are, however, always
	looking for experienced helpers in all areas of development, documentation
	and project management.
	<p>If you are a C++ software developer and have an interest in
	contributing to the simulator implementation, the best first step is
	to download the most recent source code snapshot from the CVS repository
	available from the SourceForge.net project page.  Limited design docs
	will be uploaded to the Documentation page over time, but for better
	or worse, the primary source for learning the design is typically from
	the code itself.  As you can see from the
	Development Status page, there is a vast amount of implementation required
	to be done in many very diverse areas.  Although this is a flight
	simulator, most of the work does not rely on any kind of advanced knowledge
	of aerodynamics or aircraft systems.  There are many "pure" software
	development tasks that would only require general knowledge of
	object-oriented design and coding in C++.  Once you have downloaded the
	source code, feel free to post questions or suggestions
	to the Developers forum (either the Fly! Legacy SourceForge forums or the
	AVSIM Fly! II forums) and I'll do my best to provide guidance.  Once you are
	up to speed with the code, you can create a SourceForge user account
    (free and anonymous, requiring only a valid	e-mail address) in order to be
	added to the developer team.
	<p>We are also looking for help to produce quality end-user and developer
	documentation once the project gets closer to the Alpha and Beta release
	stages.  For end-user documentation, no software development skills are
	required; only good writing skills, some free time and a thick skin, since
	this type of job sometimes tends to be the least appreciated by the user
	community and subject to some nasty complaints.
	<p>Please send any other inquiries to the
	<a href="mailto:flylegacy@users.sourceforge.net">Fly! Legacy Administrator</a>

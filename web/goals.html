    <h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>The most immediate goal is to advance the project out of the "Pre-Alpha"
	stage to an "Alpha - Technology Demo" stage.  This will constitute the
	first public release of binaries (executables) for the general user
	community.  Although it won't really be a fully functional flight sim
	at that point, it will give users a taste of the level of compatibility
	that can be expected relative to Fly! II, and serve as a kind of "proof
	of concept".  Bug reports and feature requests will not necessarily
	be acted on	during this phase, since the development team will already
	have agreed upon the content that will be delivered in each of the initial
	Alpha, Beta and Release versions.
	<p>A comprehensive list of the functionality planned for the Alpha
	demo will be provided TBD...
	<p>Following the Alpha Tech Demo, the project will progress towards
	a series of Beta releases.  At this point, all basic simulator functions
	should be implemented and the application should be stable enough so that
	the user community can start to really work with it and try to expose
	compatibility issues, bugs and incomplete features.  The Beta releases
	will be the first real opportunity for the user community to contribute
	bug reports and feature requests.  The development team will turn its
	focus almost entirely to fixing bugs and compatibility issues, rather than
	implementing any new features.  An undetermined number of successive
	Beta releases will be issued until the development team is satisfied with
	the performance, functionality and quality of the software.  At this point,
	the first Release Version (3.0.0, continuing the version numbering from
	Fly! II 2.5.240), will be made available.
	<p>The incremental functionality planned for the Beta release will be
	provided TBD...
	<p>Additional future plans will be detailed TBD...

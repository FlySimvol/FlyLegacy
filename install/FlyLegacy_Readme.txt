1. About Fly! Legacy
--------------------

1.1 What is Fly! Legacy?

Fly! Legacy is an add-on for the Fly! II flight simulator by Terminal Reality Inc. (hereafter referred to as "TRI").  Essentially it is a replacement for the main executable program for Fly! II, "fly.exe".  Some additional support files are also included in order to address some problems with original Fly! II files, or to add new features.


1.2 Is this software supported by Terminal Reality Inc.?

NO!  This software has no relationship with TRI.  After the 2.5.250 patch for Fly! II, TRI stopped any further development on the Fly! platform.  This project is entirely driven by the Fly! user community.  Other than the publically released documentation from TRI, and personal conversations between the authors and TRI employees prior to the release of the 2.5.250 patch for Fly! II, there has been no involvement in this project by anybody at TRI.  Please do not contact TRI, Gathering of Developers, TakeTwo Publishing, or any present or past employees or contractors of TRI for help or support with Fly! Legacy.  See Chapter 4 for support information.


1.3 Who was Richard Harvey?

Rich Harvey was the lead designer and architect of the original Fly! simulator, and co-producer of Fly! II.  More than that, Rich was the "public face" of TRI in the Fly! community.  Since the first release of Fly!, Rich was actively involved in the public forums at AVSIM.com, giving help and advice to users whenever he could.  During the patch processes following the releases of Fly! and Fly! II, Rich took suggestions from the user community, implemented custom features for community members who required specific functionality from the sim itself or through the SDK.

Throughout all of this, and unbeknownst to most of the community, Rich was fighting a terrible battle with  cancer.  In March 2003, seven years after first being diagnosed, Rich passed away.  Fly! Legacy is not Rich's true legacy; it is simply a computer game that attempts to continue the work Rich started with Fly! and Fly! II.  Rich's true legacy is the impact he had on the lives that he touched with his strength, courage and faith.

If you wish to make a monetary contribution in Rich's memory, there are a couple of ways you can do so.

First, there is a trust fund for Rich's daughter Lauren.  For further information or to make a donation, please contact:

Alternatively, you can contribute to the endowed scholarship in Rich's name at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.  Due to the efforts of the staff at AVSIM.com and the generosity of the flight sim community, this scholarship has reached full endowment level and now provides scholarships to deserving candidates.  See the following web page for additional information or to make a donation through PayPal:

Please remember that Fly! Legacy is free; there is never any obligation for you to make any monetary payments to anybody, at any time, for this software.  However if you wish to make a voluntary contribution to either of the above causes, that would definitely be good for your karma.

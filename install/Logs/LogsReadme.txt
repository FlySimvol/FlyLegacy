Fly! Legacy - Logs Folder README
================================


This folder contains log files generated by Fly! Legacy when various logging options are enabled in Legacy.ini, and by any default logs generated by the program (for example, "gtfo.log" which is written to whenever the program terminates due to a fatal error).  This folder should not be deleted.  See the "Troubleshooting" section of the Fly! Legacy User's Guide for additional details about how to use these log files.

The [Logs] section of FlyLegacy.ini is used to control optional log output from various subsystems.


Log File Format
---------------

Log files are plain text files that can be read in any text editor such as Wordpad.  Each log entry consists of one or more lines of output.  The first line is prefixed by a timestamp in the following format:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MMM

Note that the timestamp is the computer system time, not the time in the simulation world.


POD Filesystem Logs
-------------------

INI setting name : "logPfs"

Since Fly! Legacy must access both normal disk files and files within TRI POD files, a virtual filesystem is constructed internally to Fly! Legacy, abbreviated "PFS".  Enabling logging of POD filesystem operations can assist in debugging problems where files cannot be found, or where the wrong version of a particular file is being used.  


Terrain System Logs
-------------------

INI Setting Name : "logTerrain"

Enabling terrain system logging generates logs whenever a significant event occurs regarding rendering of terrain.  Examples of significant events are loading or unloading of terrain areas, and mounting or unmounting of sliced scenery areas.


Sky System Logs
---------------

INI Setting Name : "logSky"

When enabled, logs are generated by the sky system whenever a significant event occurs, such as manual or automatic selection of a new set of sky shading parameters.



Default Settings
----------------

All optional logs are disabled by default, corresponding to the following INI settings:

[Logs]
logPfs=0
logTerrain=0
logSky=0
